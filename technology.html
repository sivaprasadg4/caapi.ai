<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h1 class="section-title">Technology</h1>

  <p class="section-intro">
    CAAPI develops high-fidelity computational technologies by tightly
    integrating first-principles physics with scientific machine learning.
    Our approach prioritises accuracy, robustness, and deployability in
    real-world aerospace and defence systems.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Computational Physics Foundation</h2>

  <p>
    At the core of CAAPI’s technology stack are physics-based numerical solvers
    derived from governing conservation laws. These solvers are designed to
    accurately capture nonlinear phenomena such as shocks, multiphase
    interactions, and strongly coupled flow-structure effects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Emphasis is placed on high-order spatial and temporal discretisation,
    stability in extreme regimes, and extensibility across problem classes.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- SCIENTIFIC ML -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Scientific Machine Learning</h2>

  <p>
    CAAPI employs physics-informed and physics-guided machine learning
    methodologies that embed governing equations, constraints, and invariants
    directly into learning architectures.
  </p>

  <p>
    This enables data-efficient training, improved generalisation beyond
    training regimes, and physically consistent predictions under sparse or
    noisy data conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- HYBRID SOLVERS -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Hybrid Solvers & Computational Acceleration</h2>

  <p>
    To address the computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, CAAPI
    develops hybrid solver architectures that couple numerical solvers with
    learned surrogate components.
  </p>

  <p>
    These hybrids retain physical fidelity while achieving orders-of-magnitude
    reductions in runtime, enabling rapid design iteration, optimisation, and
    real-time decision support.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TRAJECTORY -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Trajectory & Ballistic Modelling</h2>

  <p>
    CAAPI’s trajectory modelling frameworks address both interior and exterior
    ballistics, incorporating propulsion dynamics, aerodynamics, environmental
    effects, and uncertainty propagation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Physics-based solvers are augmented with data-driven acceleration to enable
    fast and reliable trajectory prediction suitable for simulation,
    analysis, and decision-support applications.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- DECISION SUPPORT -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Decision Support Systems</h2>

  <p>
    Building on its modelling capabilities, CAAPI develops decision-support
    tools that integrate simulation outputs, reduced-order models, and
    uncertainty-aware predictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    These systems are designed to support planning, analysis, and engineering
    workflows in complex operational contexts, while remaining transparent and
    explainable to domain experts.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- VALIDATION -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Validation & Deployment Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    CAAPI places strong emphasis on verification, validation, and traceability.
    Models are evaluated against analytical solutions, high-fidelity reference
    simulations, and experimental or field data where available.
  </p>

  <p>
    Deployment considerations — including robustness, interpretability, and
    integration with existing workflows — are treated as first-class design
    constraints.
