  <h1 class="section-title">Solutions</h1>

  <p class="section-intro">
    CAAPI delivers computational intelligence solutions for aerospace and
    defence applications where accuracy, reliability, and decision confidence
    are critical.
  </p>
</section>
<div class="solution-divider"></div>

<!-- AEROSPACE -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Aerospace R&D & Simulation</h2>

  <p>
    Aerospace research and development increasingly relies on computational
    models to evaluate complex physical phenomena under limited experimental conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    CAAPI enables high-fidelity simulation and analysis workflows that reduce
    reliance on expensive experimental campaigns, accelerate design iteration,
    and improve confidence in early-stage engineering decisions.
  </p>
</section>
<div class="solution-divider"></div>

<!-- DEFENCE BALLISTICS -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Defence Ballistics & Fire Control Systems</h2>

  <p>
    Accurate ballistic prediction and trajectory evaluation are essential for
    defence system analysis, planning, and evaluation.
  </p>

  <p>
    CAAPI provides physics-guided computational frameworks that support
    interior and exterior ballistic analysis, enabling rapid trajectory
    assessment and informed decision-making without excessive dependence on
    empirical tables or field trials.
  </p>
</section>
<div class="solution-divider"></div>

<!-- DECISION SUPPORT -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Decision Support & Planning</h2>

  <p>
    Modern engineering and operational environments require timely decisions
    under uncertainty, informed by complex and often incomplete data.
  </p>

  <p>
    CAAPI develops decision-support tools that integrate simulation outputs,
    reduced-order representations, and uncertainty-aware predictions to assist
    planning, evaluation, and mission-critical engineering workflows.
  </p>
</section>
<div class="solution-divider"></div>

<!-- PLATFORM -->
<section class="container reveal">
  <h2 class="section-title">Platform & Integration Use</h2>

  <p>
    CAAPI’s solutions are designed to integrate with existing computational
    pipelines, analysis tools, and operational workflows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modular architectures and deployment-aware design enable flexible adoption
    across research, evaluation, and decision-support environments without
    disruption to established processes.
